#	Triggers to control if diplomatic actions are enabled:
#		Format:
#
#		<diplomatic action tag>_enabled_trigger = {
#			<trigger contents>
#		}
#
#		ROOT is the country initiating the diplomatic action.
#		FROM is the recipient or target of the diplomatic action.
#
#		Note:  For cleaner tooltips, it is recommended that you use
#			if triggers within the enable triggers, and a single
#			custom_trigger_tooltip trigger within each if trigger.
#
#		Example: (Germany is prevented from declaring war on the Soviet Union.)
